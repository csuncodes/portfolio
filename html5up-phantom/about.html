							<h1>About</h1>

							<p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site! You probably clicked this page to get to know a little bit about me.</p>
							<p>My name is Claire, a Neuroscience and Computer Science major from Brandeis University. I became interested in technology in my freshman year of college due to the local Makerlab. They focus on educating the student body on emerging technology.
							I developed a facination for 3D printers and their applications. After learning more about the technology, I became passionate on teaching others and became a lecturer for the Makerlab. I've given talks at Makerfaire several times, MIT, and Brandeis events.
						After learning about the potential of 3D printing, I wanted to diversify and went on to work towards a computer science degree. </p>
					<p>I discovered I wanted to use technology to build products that help people. I learned how to build voice interactions after taking a program at my university. The final product from that course eventually became the winner of an award for Best Voice Interaction (take a look at the DocFinder page for more details).
						The project was to ease the process of finding a doctor. After being invited to the Conversational Interaction conference, I could see that voice interfaces were one of the next interfaces to become pervasive (you've already probably know what a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa are, to prove my point).
						I currently work as a software developer for Involution Studios in Arlington, MA. We develop applications for healthcare and firmly believe in opensourcing information.</p>
						<p>I enjoy learning about up-and-coming tech, be it voice, VR/AR, and these blockchains that people talk about nowadays. I currently work in voice but foresee jumping to whatever the new tech scene is.</p>
